**Server**: You have a single server that hosts all the components of the web infrastructure.

**Web Server**: Install and configure Nginx as the web server on the server. Nginx will handle incoming HTTP requests from users.

**Application Server**: Install an application server, such as Gunicorn or uWSGI, on the server. The application server will be responsible for executing your code base and handling dynamic content generation.

**Application Files**: Upload your code base to the server. This includes all the files required to run your website/application.

**Database**: Install and configure MySQL as the database management system on the server. The database will store and manage the website/application data.

**Domain Name**: Configure the domain name "foobar.com" with a DNS record. Add a "www" record that points to your server's IP address, which in this case is 8.8.8.8.

About this infrastructure:

-   **What is a server**: A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to other computers or clients. In this case, it hosts the web infrastructure for the website.
    
-   **What is the role of the domain name**: The domain name is a user-friendly way to identify and access a website. It provides a memorable name (like "foobar.com") that can be used instead of remembering the server's IP address.
    
-   **What type of DNS record is "www" in [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com)**: The "www" is a subdomain, and in this case, it is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. The CNAME record points the "www" subdomain to the main domain (foobar.com).
    
-   **What is the role of the web server**: The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users and serves static files (like HTML, CSS, and images). It can also perform other tasks like load balancing and caching.
    
-   **What is the role of the application server**: The application server (Gunicorn or uWSGI) executes the dynamic code of your website/application. It processes user requests, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic content to be sent back to the user's browser.
    
-   **What is the role of the database**: The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website/application data. It allows you to organize, retrieve, and modify the data needed for your website/application.
    
-   **What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website**: The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP protocol. When the user requests the website, the server sends back the corresponding HTML, CSS, and other assets to be rendered by the user's browser.
    

Issues with this infrastructure:

-   **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Since there is only one server, it becomes a single point of failure. If the server goes down, the website/application will become inaccessible. To mitigate this, you can introduce redundancy and fault-tolerance measures like adding multiple servers or implementing backup systems.
    
-   **Downtime during maintenance**: When performing maintenance tasks like deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, resulting in temporary downtime. To minimize this, you can use techniques like rolling deployments or load balancers to ensure continuous availability while updating the system.
    
-   **Limited scalability**: With a single server, this infrastructure may struggle to handle a high volume of incoming traffic. To scale the system, you can introduce load balancers, additional servers, or cloud-based solutions that allow horizontal scaling.
    

Remember, this is a basic setup, and there are various ways to design web infrastructures depending on specific requirements and considerations.
