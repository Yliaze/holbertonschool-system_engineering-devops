Explanation of the infrastructure:

1.  **Server 1 and Server 2**: Two servers are added to provide redundancy and improve fault tolerance. If one server goes down, the other can handle the traffic, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.
    
2.  **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**: The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers. It uses a distribution algorithm, such as round-robin or least connections, to determine which server should handle each request. This helps distribute the load evenly and improve performance.
    
3.  **Web Server (Nginx)**: Nginx is used as the web server to handle incoming HTTP requests. It serves static files, such as HTML, CSS, and images, and can also handle other tasks like load balancing, caching, and SSL termination.
    
4.  **Application Server**: The application server runs your code base and handles the dynamic content generation. It processes user requests, interacts with the database, and generates the dynamic content to be sent back to the users.
    
5.  **Database (MySQL)**: MySQL is used as the database management system to store and manage the website/application data. It provides data persistence and allows the application server to retrieve and modify the data as needed.
    

Specifics about the infrastructure:

-   **Load Balancer Algorithm**: The load balancer is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm. It evenly distributes incoming requests across the available servers in a cyclic manner.
    
-   **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive**: The load balancer enables an Active-Passive setup. In this setup, one server actively handles the traffic (active), while the other server remains idle and serves as a backup (passive). If the active server fails, the passive server takes over to ensure continuous availability.
    
-   **Primary-Replica Database Cluster**: The database is set up as a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster. The primary node (master) handles write operations and replicates the data to the replica node (slave). The replica node handles read operations and provides redundancy in case the primary node fails.
    
-   **Difference between Primary and Replica Nodes**: The primary node is responsible for processing write operations, ensuring data consistency, and managing database changes. The replica node is used for read operations and serves as a backup in case the primary node becomes unavailable. It provides improved read scalability and can be promoted to the primary role if needed.
    

Issues with the infrastructure:

-   **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Although the infrastructure includes redundancy with multiple servers, there can still be single points of failure, such as the load balancer or the database. If any of these components fail, it can impact the availability of the website.
    
-   **Security Issues**: The infrastructure lacks important security measures like firewalls and HTTPS. Firewalls help protect the servers from unauthorized access and attacks, while HTTPS ensures secure communication between the server and the users by encrypting the data transmission.
    
-   **No Monitoring**: Monitoring tools are not included in the infrastructure. Monitoring is crucial to track the performance, health, and availability of the servers, applications, and databases. It helps identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure smooth operation.
